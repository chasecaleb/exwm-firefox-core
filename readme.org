* exwm-firefox-core
This package contains functions that execute exwm keypresses mapped in firefox to the action described in the function name.

This package is only a library so it does not contain any keybindings If you don't want to bind the functions yourself, check out other packages using this library such as [[https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-evil][exwm-firefox-evil]]

Since this library contains a lot of autoloads, it is recommended to load it with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load 'exwm (require 'exwm-firefox-core))
#+END_SRC
